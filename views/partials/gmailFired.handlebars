Hello Walter,<br/><br/>

Upon further investigations, we are lead to believe of your ongoing affairs with Elaina Jodi. This email confirms that your employment with ZenTech is terminated effective immediately. Please do not bother coming into the office today. We have packed your items and will schedule a deliver during the next 1-2 business days.<br/><br/>

Unfortunately, we cannot offer you a severance package for violating Part IV, Section B of the employee policy handbook:<br/><br/>
<div class="gmail-quote">"… Employees are prohibited to engage in sexual activity in the workplace. The company may periodically evaluate an employee’s performance and set out an investigation if deemed necessary. … Anyone violating this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination with no benefits."</div><br/>

Additionally, your final paycheck will be deposited into your account on your regular payday.<br/><br/>

You will need to keep the company informed of your contact information so we are able to provide you with your W2 form and other important documents.<br/><br/>

Please let us know if you have any questions.<br/><br/>

Regards,<br/><br/>

Deborah Bleiweiss<br/>
<i>Assistant Director Human Resources</i><br/><br/>
